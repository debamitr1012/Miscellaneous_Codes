## Week 1:
1. Find the second largest and second smallest number simultaneously in an array using Divide & Conquer Principle.
2. Given a sorted array and a number X, search two elements of the array such that their sum is X. Expected time complexity is O(n).
3. Apply Binary Search on 2D NxM array (A) having numbers stored in non-decreasing order under row-major scanning.
4. Given a sorted array and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in the array. Expected time complexity is O(logn). 

## Week 2:
1. Median of two sorted arrays: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B; each of size n. Write analgorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays (i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)) 
2. A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing. A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. Find bitonic point in a bitonic sequence. 
3. Given an array of digits, sort them with time complexity O(n).
4. Apply Merge Sort to count inversion pairs in an array. Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion pair if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Example: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

## Week 3:
1. Find neighbours of the median element in an array using partitioning strategy of Quick-Sorting method. 
2. Apply Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication strategy for odd dimensional square matrix. 
3. Arrange a list of words (each of equal length) using dictionary sorting strategy. 

## Week 4:
1. Given a value V and infinite supply of coins of m-denominations {C1=1 < C2<C3<.....<Cm}, we want to make change for Rs. V. Apply DP strategy to find out minimum number of coins to make the change?
2. Given a cost 2D-matrix and a position (m, n), write a function that returns cost of minimum cost-path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0). 
3. Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum. 

## Week 5:
1. Given an array p[] which represents the chain of matrices such that the i-th matrix Ai is of dimension p[i-1] x p[i]. We need to write a function that should return the optimal parenthesizing expression resulting minimum multiplication cost to multiply the chain. 
2. Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. You cannot break an item, either pick the item, or don’t pick it. 

## Week 6:
1. Implement all pairs of Shortest path algorithm for a graph using Floyd-Warshall’s strategy.
2. Implement DP strategy to solve Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP).

## Week 7:
1. Find the smallest number with given digit sum s and number of digits d? Input : s = 9, d = 2, Output : 18 
2. Implement a greedy algorithm to solve fractional knapsack problem.
3. Implement greedy algorithm to solve the problem of Job Sequencing with deadlines.

## Week 8:
1. Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding shortest path.
2. Implement Bellman-Ford’s algorithm for finding shortest path.
3. Implement BFS and DFS for a given undirected graph and starting vertex.

## Week 9:
1. You are given a 3×3 board with 8 tiles (every tile has one number from 1 to 8 and one space is empty). The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match final configuration using the empty space. We can slide four adjacent (left, right, above and below) tiles into the empty space.
2. The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen-problem.

## Week 10:
1. KMP String Matching: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m. Text: A A B A A C A A D A A B A A B A, Pattern: A A B A
2. Write an approximation algorithm for TSP with triangle inequality. Your solution should be at most twice worst with respect to the optimal solution.
