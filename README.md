## Week 1:
1. Find the second largest and second smallest number simultaneously in an array using Divide & Conquer Principle.
2. Given a sorted array and a number X, search two elements of the array such that their sum is X. Expected time complexity is O(n).
3. Apply Binary Search on 2D NxM array (A) having numbers stored in non-decreasing order under row-major scanning.
4. Given a sorted array and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in the array. Expected time complexity is O(logn). 

## Week 2:
1. Median of two sorted arrays: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B; each of size n. Write analgorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays (i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)) 
2. A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing. A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. Find bitonic point in a bitonic sequence. 
3. Given an array of digits, sort them with time complexity O(n).
4. Apply Merge Sort to count inversion pairs in an array. Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion pair if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Example: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

## Week 3:
1. Find neighbours of the median element in an array using partitioning strategy of Quick-Sorting method. 
2. Apply Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication strategy for odd dimensional square matrix. 
3. Arrange a list of words (each of equal length) using dictionary sorting strategy.
